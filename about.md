# Welcome, stranger

If you're here, you probably know who I am. If not, does that make me a niche microceleb, or a well-liked shitposter? To be honest, both sound good.

## Who I am

I'm Riven Skaye, you can find me in most places under that name though you might need to remove the space or add an underscore. I'm a software engineer by day, and cursed code conjurer by night. My interests are pretty broad though; from horseback riding and archery to story-heavy games and animanga, light novels and normal books. I also do stuff like kitchen and bathroom remodels myself, for fun. I do all this with some unholy mix of rock, metal, j-pop, and some folk music. Y'know, the kind played on classical instruments like the violin, koto and harp. Oh and some classical as well, from time to time.

## About this blog

Ramblings of an Alchemist is basically just a blog about whatever pet projects I have going on. That's usually code projects, but I might just start posting about other stuff from time to time. Topical blogs are fun, but I don't wanna end up having my life revolve around a single topic.

As for specifics on what to expect, I have no idea. As of initial posting, I'm writing about a safe Rust interface for using Named Shared Memory on Windows so people can use its `shmem`/`mmap` equivalent without too much hassle.  
The one thing I _do_ know is that I don't expect to get many readers. Writing is honestly just one of those things I find fun to do. And something mildly informational might be useful for backreading my own progress, or to point someone else at for more information. If you do like it, or if you have any feedback, poke me on Discord as `@rivenskaye` or [shoot me an email](mailto:riven@tae.moe). Yes, I use old people communication too! I also take paper mail by post, pigeon, or owl if you must, but please contact me elsewhere for the address to send it to first.  
No, I do NOT want thigh highs mailed to my house. I'm not naming anyone, froststare and dapper know who they are ‚ù§Ô∏è
