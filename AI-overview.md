# Index of AI-related postings

The posts in this category are all opinions, personal worry, and distaste for the huge load of AI bullshit that's all
around these days. From disagreeing that 80% of devs need AI skills by 2027, to just ranting about GPT slop.  
As always, these views and opinions are personal and don't reflect what current or future employers may think or feel.
